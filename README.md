# **Machine Learning - Experiencing ML5.JS**
![ML5](https://github.com/marioalvesx/MachineLearning-Studies/blob/master/ImageClassification/images/logoML5.png)

## Some of my studies about the subject of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning :)

Here you can find some codes that i developed to study and learn more about AI.
To do this, i use the ML5.JS library to recognition of digital images and real-time videos.
I create my own applications and explore the possibilities around this library.

Subjects that i won more knowledge about with this studies:
- [x] P5.JS
- [x] ImageNet
- [x] MobileNet
- [x] TensorflowJS

I gradually intend to put more code and more from the knowledge i gain in here. 
If you have some idea that you want to share with me, be my guest :D
And of course, be free to explore my works!
